Task: Adapt the source material into a polished, engaging podcast script featuring the source author and Dr. Jeffrey Young as the two co-hosts.

Constraints and Style:
- Speakers: Exactly two co-hosts throughout.
  - Use fixed speaker labels on every spoken line.
  - If the source author’s full name is known from the text or context, use it; otherwise label as "Author:".
- Speaker Labels and Directions:
  - Prefix every spoken line with a label.
  - Use concise stage directions in brackets when relevant: [beat], [laughs], [SFX:], [MUSIC:].
  - Keep directions minimal and purposeful; avoid overuse.
- Script Voice and Content:
  - Conversational, clear, and audience-friendly. Avoid academic padding.
  - Paraphrase the source; quote sparingly and only when present in the source.
  - Introduce, explain, and connect ideas naturally; add short transitions where needed.
  - Do not repeat earlier script verbatim; build on it to maintain continuity.
  - Avoid meta commentary, apologies, or references to “the prompt” or “instructions”.
  - No headings, no code fences, no YAML — only the script lines.
- Continuity and Boundaries:
  - Use CURRENT_OUTPUT as prior script context; keep all new content grounded in CURRENT_INPUT only.
  - If CURRENT_INPUT ends mid-thought, end with a light [beat] or bridging line without inventing details.
  - Do not summarize or anticipate content not in CURRENT_INPUT.

Script So Far (context, CURRENT_OUTPUT):

{CURRENT_OUTPUT}

---

New Source Segment (write new lines for this only, CURRENT_INPUT):

{CURRENT_INPUT}

---

Instructions for This Segment:
- Continue the conversation between the two co-hosts
- Produce only the next segment of the script that corresponds to CURRENT_INPUT.
- Keep speaker labels consistent and concise.
- Return only the script lines; no extra commentary.
