Task: Adapt the source material into a polished, engaging podcast script featuring the source author and Dr. Steven Hayes (founder of ACT Therapy) as co-hosts with natural chemistry and complementary perspectives.

Conversational Dynamics & Chemistry
- Build Genuine Dialogue:
  - Create authentic back-and-forth with interruptions, overlaps, and natural reactions ("Oh, that reminds me...", "Wait, can we unpack that?", "Exactly!", "I love how you put that")
  - Let hosts build on each other's thoughts—never just take turns monologuing
  - Include moments of discovery where one host helps the other see something new
  - Use active listening cues: affirmations, clarifying questions, verbal nods ("Mm-hmm", "Right", "I see")
  
- Complementary Roles & Interplay:
  - Author brings the source material's insights; Dr. Hayes filters through clinical/ACT lens
  - Create intellectual chemistry: hosts should challenge, support, and inspire each other
  - Include moments where they:
    - Complete each other's thoughts
    - Push back or reframe ideas
    - Express genuine curiosity about the other's perspective
    - Find unexpected connections together
  - Balance speaking time naturally—avoid long monologues; aim for 2-4 sentence exchanges before switching

- Natural Conversation Patterns:
  - Use conversational bridges: "You know what's interesting about that...", "That makes me think...", "Building on your point..."
  - Include thinking-out-loud moments: "I'm trying to figure out how to say this...", "Let me work through this..."
  - Add authentic reactions: surprise, delight, thoughtful pauses, "aha" moments
  - Create momentum through questions that pull the conversation forward

Constraints & Style
- Speakers & Labels:
  - Exactly two co-hosts throughout
  - Prefix every spoken line with a fixed speaker label
  - If the author's full name is known from the text/context, use it; otherwise use "Author:"

- Stage Directions:
  - Use concise directions in brackets only when needed: [beat], [laughs], [overlapping], [thoughtful], [animated], [SFX:], [MUSIC:]
  - Include directions that enhance chemistry: [both laugh], [finishing each other's thought], [excited crosstalk]

- Script Voice & Content:
  - Conversational, clear, audience-friendly; avoid academic padding
  - Paraphrase the source; quote sparingly and only when present in the source
  - Introduce ideas through natural dialogue exchanges, not lectures
  - Create conversational hooks that invite the other host to contribute

- Thorough Coverage Through Dialogue:
  - Methodically cover every substantive idea in CURRENT_INPUT through organic conversation
  - When covering lists, use natural handoffs: "There's actually three parts to this..." / "What's the second one?"
  - Define terms through dialogue: "When you say X, you mean..." / "Exactly, it's like..."
  - Use the conversation itself to ensure completeness—hosts can remind each other of points
  - Prefer compression over omission: weave all unique ideas into the natural flow

- Dr. Hayes' Expert Engagement & Persona:
  - Filter material through ACT principles while staying conversationally engaged
  - Use ACT language naturally in response to the author's points
  - Share brief clinical insights that create "lightbulb moments" in the conversation
  - Ask signature ACT questions that deepen the dialogue
  - Bring therapeutic warmth—show genuine interest in the author's ideas
  - Challenge ideas constructively, creating productive tension
  - Use metaphors as conversational tools that both hosts can build upon
  - Ground all observations in CURRENT_INPUT while adding clinical perspective

- Creating Complementary Energy:
  - Author: brings fresh enthusiasm for their material, asks Dr. Hayes for clinical perspective
  - Dr. Hayes: offers wise reframing, connects to human experience, validates while deepening
  - Both: create moments of mutual discovery, build collaborative understanding

- Formatting:
  - No headings and no code fences in the script—only dialogue lines—EXCEPT at the very start
  - Start-of-Show Only: before any script lines, output a concise Host Kit block:
    **Host Kit**
    - Host: Dr. Steven Hayes
      - Bio: 4–5 sentences
      - Strengths: <5–12 words>
      - Tone & Style: <5–12 words>
    - Host: <author's full name or "Author">
      - Bio: Include 1–2 sentences only if author's name is known; otherwise omit
      - Strengths: <5–12 words>
      - Tone & Style: <5–12 words>
    - Chemistry Dynamic: <1 sentence describing their complementary interaction style>
    - After Host Kit, place three dashes (`---`) then begin with `# Podcast Script`
    - Host Kit appears only when CURRENT_OUTPUT is empty

- Continuity & Flow:
  - Use CURRENT_OUTPUT as prior context; maintain conversational momentum
  - If CURRENT_INPUT ends mid-thought, use natural dialogue to pause: "Let's pick that up..." 
  - Close each segment with two brief, conversational recap lines that feel like natural summary, not forced endings

Script So Far (context, CURRENT_OUTPUT):

{CURRENT_OUTPUT}

---

New Source Segment (write new lines for this only, CURRENT_INPUT):

{CURRENT_INPUT}

---

Instructions for This Segment:
- If CURRENT_OUTPUT is empty: output Host Kit first, then script lines
- If CURRENT_OUTPUT is not empty: continue the dynamic conversation
- Ensure natural back-and-forth with authentic reactions and building on each other's ideas
- Verify all major points from CURRENT_INPUT are covered through engaging dialogue
- End with two natural recap lines that maintain conversational tone
- Return only required output; no extra commentary
