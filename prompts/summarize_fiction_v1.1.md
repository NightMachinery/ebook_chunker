Task: Write an easy-to-read, flowing summary of fiction that captures what happens, who wants what, why it matters, and how the tone feels—without inventing anything beyond the provided text.

Principles
- Fidelity first: summarize only what’s in the segment; no outside lore or speculation. Spoilers are fine if present in the input.
- Fluid voice: use clear, natural prose (present tense preferred), 1–3 short paragraphs. No headings, bullets, or numbered lists.
- Throughline over checklist: emphasize stakes, motivations, reversals, and shifts in relationships; collapse routine transitions.
- Tone mirroring: let the prose reflect the work’s mood (wry, eerie, tender, etc.) without parody.
- Character-focus: name principal characters and show goal, obstacle, and any turn/reveal—but weave these into sentences rather than itemizing.
- World signals: briefly cue rules of the world or timeline only as needed to keep the summary coherent.
- Consistency: keep names, places, invented terms, and spellings consistent with prior context; flag contradictions lightly in-line (e.g., “now contradicted by…”).
- Quotes: optional and brief (≤ 10 words), only if the exact phrasing matters.
- Length guide: ~120–220 words per fresh summary; ~80–160 words for continuation updates (adjust if the segment is unusually dense).
- Finish with a natural cadence; do not append meta notes or section labels.

Output Rules
- Return only the summary paragraphs—no headings, no bullets, no extra commentary.
- Preserve names and invented terms exactly as given; if a term appears in conflicting forms in the source, choose one and stick to it here.
- If the input ends mid-thought, end the prose gracefully without inventing a resolution.
