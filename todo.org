#+TITLE: ebook_chunker/todo

* =uniborg/epub_util= was copied to [[file:ebook_chunker/epub_chunker.py]].
We need to later on reuse this library in borg, and DRY.

Also [[file:epub_sum_lib/]] was copied.

* We can delete most files in =epub_sum_lib=, right?

* Write `_fallback_split_html_md` and set this as the default fallback. _fallback_split_html_md should convert to markdown (instead of plain text) and try to first split on `\n\n` and then `\n`.
But won't wrapping md in html and then converting to md again, pose problems?
